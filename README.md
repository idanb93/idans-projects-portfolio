# Synopsis

In this project I built a client application - Projects Portfolio which shows all of my projects. I used React.js, Redux.js

The client application is deployed on AWS S3 bucket, I have purchased a domain from GoDaddy, added a public SSL certificate from AWS, added a cloudfront distribution and configured a command to clear it's cache whenever i am deploying changes in the project.

## Goals

- build a portfolio page that looks great, using React.
- learn about the pros of using a front-end framework(React), Divide into small components, Components hierarchy, States, Props, Hooks. 
- learn how to deploy a static website on AWS.

## Motivation

During the project I experimented with the following:

- Experinced with React, Components, States, Hooks.
- Experinced with a state management Redux, Connecting the different components to the store and updating the store.
- Experienced with creating AWS S3 Bucket, Create AWS Route 53 to manage DNS records for the website, Purchasing a domain from GoDaddy, doing DNS configurations
creating a public SSL certificate and pin it to Route 53, use CloudFront distribution to attach the SSL certificate to the website, Clearing CloudFront cache everytime i deploy new changes to the project.
